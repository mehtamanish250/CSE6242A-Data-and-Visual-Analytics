Q3.a.2) Intuitively and graphically, Feature 10 (Wins and nominations) vs. Feature 6 (IMDb Rating) is a better combination at spreading the classes because the more wins and nominations a movie has, the better quality movie it is and better will be its rating.

Q3.c) Log or square root scales are used in scatterplots to deal with skewness in data. Data gets more evenly distributed so easier to interpret. Square root scale can handle zeros in data, better for smaller domains. Log scale indicates stronger transformation, handles larger domains but not zero or negative values.
